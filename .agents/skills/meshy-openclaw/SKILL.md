# Meshy 3D — Generation + Printing

Directly communicate with the Meshy AI API to generate and print 3D assets. Covers the complete lifecycle: API key setup, task creation, exponential backoff polling, downloading, multi-step pipelines, and 3D print preparation with slicer integration.

---

## SECURITY MANIFEST

**Environment variables accessed:**
- `MESHY_API_KEY` — API authentication token sent in HTTP `Authorization: Bearer` header only. Never logged, never written to any file except `.env` in the current working directory when explicitly requested by the user.

**External network endpoints:**
- `https://api.meshy.ai` — Meshy AI API (task creation, status polling, model/image downloads)

**File system access:**
- Read: `.env` / `.env.local` in the current working directory only (API key lookup)
- Write: `.env` in the current working directory only (API key storage, only on user request)
- Write: `./meshy_output/` in the current working directory (downloaded model files, metadata)
- Read: files explicitly provided by the user (e.g., local images passed for image-to-3D conversion), accessed only at the exact path the user specifies
- No access to home directories, shell profiles, or any path outside the above

**Data leaving this machine:**
- API requests to `api.meshy.ai` include the `MESHY_API_KEY` in the Authorization header and user-provided text prompts or image URLs. No other local data is transmitted. Downloaded model files are saved locally only.

## IMPORTANT: First-Use Session Notice

When this skill is first activated in a session, inform the user:

> All generated files will be saved to `meshy_output/` in the current working directory. Each project gets its own folder (`{YYYYMMDD_HHmmss}_{prompt}_{id}/`) with model files, textures, thumbnails, and metadata. History is tracked in `meshy_output/history.json`.

This only needs to be said **once per session**.

---

## IMPORTANT: File Organization

All downloaded files MUST go into a structured `meshy_output/` directory in the current working directory. **Do NOT scatter files randomly.**

- Each project: `meshy_output/{YYYYMMDD_HHmmss}_{prompt_slug}_{task_id_prefix}/`
- Chained tasks (preview → refine → rig) reuse the same `project_dir`
- Track tasks in `metadata.json` per project, and global `history.json`
- Auto-download thumbnails alongside models

The bundled CLI implements this: `project-dir`, `record`, and `thumbnail` subcommands.

---

## IMPORTANT: Shell Command Rules

Use only standard POSIX tools. Do NOT use `rg`, `fd`, `bat`, `exa`/`eza`.

---

## IMPORTANT: Run Long Tasks Properly

Meshy generation takes 1–5 minutes. Run each `poll` as a single Bash call and let it finish — the bundled CLI prints unbuffered progress in real time. Tasks sitting at 99% for 30–120s is normal finalization — do NOT interrupt. Pass a larger `--timeout` for heavy tasks instead of retrying.

---

## IMPORTANT: Never Rebuild Bundled Scripts

`scripts/meshy_task.py` is the single source of truth for `create_task` / `poll_task` / `download` / `get_project_dir` / `record_task` / `save_thumbnail`. **Never retype, paraphrase, or "reconstruct" these helpers from memory** — not even partially. Compose CLI calls in bash, or write a small Python script that does `sys.path.insert(0, "<this skill's scripts dir>")` and `from meshy_task import ...`.

---

## Step 0: API Key Detection (ALWAYS RUN FIRST)

**Only the current session environment and `.env` / `.env.local` in the current working directory are checked. Never scan home directories or shell profile files.**

```bash
python3 scripts/meshy_task.py check-env
```

### Decision After Detection

- **`READY: key=...`** → Proceed to Step 1.
- **`READY: NO_KEY_FOUND`** → Go to Step 0a.
- **`PYTHON_REQUESTS: MISSING`** → Run `pip install requests`.

---

## Step 0a: API Key Setup (Only If No Key Found)

Follow [references/setup.md](references/setup.md): create a key at https://www.meshy.ai/settings/api (Pro plan required), verify it against `GET /openapi/v1/balance`, and optionally persist it to `.env` in the current project (auto-added to `.gitignore`).

---

## Step 1: Confirm Plan With User Before Spending Credits

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any task, present the user with a cost summary and wait for confirmation:

```
I'll generate a 3D model of "<prompt>" using the following plan:

  1. Preview (mesh generation) — 20 credits
  2. Refine (texturing with PBR) — 10 credits
  3. Download as .glb

  Total cost: 30 credits
  Current balance: <N> credits

  Shall I proceed?
```

For multi-step pipelines (text-to-3d → rig → animate), show the FULL pipeline cost upfront.

> **Note:** Rigging automatically includes walking + running animations at no extra cost. Only add `Animate` (3 credits) for custom animations beyond those.

### Intent → API Mapping

| User wants to... | API | Endpoint | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3D model from text | Text to 3D | `POST /openapi/v2/text-to-3d` | 5–20 (preview) + 10 (refine) |
| 3D model from one image | Image to 3D | `POST /openapi/v1/image-to-3d` | 5–30 |
| 3D model from multiple images | Multi-Image to 3D | `POST /openapi/v1/multi-image-to-3d` | 5–30 |
| New textures on existing model | Retexture | `POST /openapi/v1/retexture` | 10 |
| Change mesh format/topology | Remesh | `POST /openapi/v1/remesh` | 5 |
| Convert a model to other formats (no remesh) | Convert | `POST /openapi/v1/convert` | 1 |
| Rescale a model to real-world size | Resize | `POST /openapi/v1/resize` | 1 |
| Generate fresh UVs (GLB, ≤40k faces) before external texturing | UV Unwrap | `POST /openapi/v1/uv-unwrap` | 5 |

| Optimize/edit a 2D image (recommended pre-step before image-to-3d) | Image to Image | `POST /openapi/v1/image-to-image` | 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 |
| Photo → styled physical product (figure/lamp/keychain/fridge-magnet) | Creative Lab | `POST /openapi/creative-lab/{product}/v1/prototype` then `.../build` | 6 + 30 |
| Check FDM printability | Analyze Printability | `POST /openapi/v1/print/analyze` | **0 (free)** |
| Repair non-manifold/degenerate-face/hole topology | Repair Printability | `POST /openapi/v1/print/repair` | 10 |
| Multi-color 3D print | Multi-Color Print | `POST /openapi/v1/print/multi-color` | 10 (+ generation) |
| 3D print a model (white) | → See 3D Printing Workflow section | — | 20 |
| Check credit balance | Balance | `GET /openapi/v1/balance` | 0 |

---

## Step 2: Execute the Workflow

All generation endpoints return `{"result": "<task_id>"}`, NOT the model — you MUST poll. **NEVER** read `model_urls` from the POST response.

Every workflow is a sequence of calls to the bundled CLI `scripts/meshy_task.py` — do not write your own API code:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `check-env` | Step 0 environment report |
| `balance` | Current credit balance |
| `create --endpoint E (--payload JSON \| --payload-file F)` | Create a task; prints the new task ID |
| `poll --endpoint E --task-id ID [--timeout 300] [--project-dir D]` | Poll to completion; saves the task JSON into the project dir |
| `get --endpoint E --task-id ID [--save F]` | One-shot status / progress / face_count check |
| `download (--url U \| --task-json F [--format FMT]) --output PATH` | Stream-download a model file |
| `project-dir --task-id ID [--prompt P]` | Create + print the project folder path |
| `record --project-dir D --task-id ID --task-type T --stage S [--files "a,b"]` | Update `metadata.json` + `history.json` |
| `thumbnail --project-dir D (--url U \| --task-json F)` | Save the project thumbnail |
| `check-faces --endpoint E --task-id ID [--max-faces 300000]` | Pre-rigging polycount gate |

Follow the matching recipe in [references/pipelines.md](references/pipelines.md): **Text to 3D** (preview → refine), **Image to 3D**, **Multi-Image to 3D**, **Retexture**, **Remesh**, **Convert / Resize / UV Unwrap**, **Auto-Rigging + Animation** (textured humanoid + t-pose + face-count gate; look `action_id` up in the public catalog), **Text/Image to Image**.

**2D Optimization Pre-Step (strongly recommended):** prefer the image-to-3d route over direct text-to-3d — for a text-only request, first make a design image via `/openapi/v1/text-to-image` (`nano-banana-pro`; characters: `generate_multi_view: true` + `pose_mode`), then 3D-ify. For low-quality reference images, clean up first via `/openapi/v1/image-to-image`. 3–9 extra credits typically buy a noticeable quality bump. Skip when the user provides a clean studio shot, and always skip for Creative Lab products (they stylize internally).

---

## 3D Printing Workflow

**IMPORTANT: When the user's request involves 3D printing, use this section for the ENTIRE workflow — including model generation.** Do NOT run the generation workflows above and then come here. This section controls `target_formats` and other print-specific parameters from the start.

Trigger when the user mentions: print, 3d print, slicer, slice, bambu, orca, prusa, cura, multicolor, multi-color, 3mf, figurine, miniature, statue, physical model, desk toy, phone stand.

### Decision: White Model vs Multicolor

1. **Detect installed slicers** first: `python3 scripts/slicers.py detect`
2. Ask the user: "White model (single-color) or multicolor?"
3. If **multicolor**: check for multicolor-capable slicer (OrcaSlicer, Bambu Studio, Creality Print, Elegoo Slicer, Anycubic Slicer Next), ask max_colors (1-16, default 4) and max_depth (3-6, default 4), confirm cost: 40 credits (+10 if repair is needed)
4. **(Recommended)** After generation, run a **printability analysis** (`POST /openapi/v1/print/analyze`, FREE). Run **`POST /openapi/v1/print/repair`** (10 credits) only if status = error.

Then follow the full walkthroughs in [references/printing.md](references/printing.md):

- **White Model Pipeline** (20 credits): generate untextured (`target_formats: ["obj"]`) → download OBJ → `scripts/fix_obj.py` (Y-up→Z-up, scale to mm, center, bottom at Z=0) → open in slicer
- **Multicolor Pipeline** (40 credits): generate + texture (refine/retexture REQUIRED) → multi-color API → download 3MF → open in multicolor slicer. The multi-color API outputs 3MF directly — no coordinate conversion, no `target_formats` needed at generation.
- **Creative Lab** (36 credits): photo → `prototype` (6) → `build` (30) → textured GLB, ready to print; multicolor via `model_url`.
- **Print-quality checklist** (wall thickness, overhangs, base stability, …) is in [references/printing.md](references/printing.md#manual-sanity-checks-in-addition-to-the-automated-analyze-api).

Key rules: always detect slicer first and report; always run the FREE analyze for production/functional prints; repair only on `error` (or `warning` when quality matters); repair does NOT preserve textures (repair → re-texture → multicolor); if OBJ is unavailable, download GLB and import manually; after opening in a slicer, remind the user to check print settings (layer height, infill, supports).

---

## Step 3: Report Results

After task succeeds:
1. Downloaded file paths and sizes
2. Task IDs (for follow-up: refine, rig, retexture)
3. Available formats (list `model_urls` keys)
4. Credits consumed + current balance (task JSON has `consumed_credits`; run `balance`)
5. Suggested next steps:
   - Preview done → "Want to refine (add textures)?"
   - Model done → "Want to rig this character?"
   - Rigged → "Want to apply a custom animation?"
   - Any textured model → "Want to 3D print this? Multicolor printing is available!"
   - Any model → "Want to 3D print this?"

---

## Error Recovery

On any failure, follow [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md): HTTP status handling (401/402/422/429/5xx), retry policy, and known task `FAILED` messages. The bundled CLI auto-reports the current balance on 402 and exits non-zero with the server's error message on failure.

---

## Known Behaviors & Constraints

- **99% stall**: Normal finalization (30–120s). Do NOT interrupt.
- **Asset retention**: Files deleted after **3 days** (non-Enterprise). Download immediately.
- **PBR maps**: Must set `enable_pbr: true` explicitly.
- **Refine**: Works with `meshy-5`, `meshy-6`, or `latest` — pick the same family as your preview for consistency. 10 credits regardless of model. (`meshy-4` is retired → 400.)
- **Deprecated params**: `symmetry_mode` no longer affects output; `art_style` is ignored by Meshy-6; use `pose_mode` instead of the old `is_a_t_pose` flag; use `texture_resolution` (`"2k"`/`"4k"`/`"8k"`) instead of `hd_texture`; on image-to-3d use `model_type: "smart-topology"` (with `ai_model: "meshy-t2"`) instead of the deprecated `"lowpoly"`. Smart Topology is image-to-3d only — Text to 3D and Multi-Image to 3D don't have it.
- **Rigging needs textures**: rig the *textured* task (text-to-3d **refine**, or image-to-3d with `should_texture: true`) — untextured meshes are unsupported, so a mesh-only preview fails. Also: bipedal humanoid only, ≤300k faces via `input_task_id`, and a `model_url` model must face +Z.
- **Inspect before downloading**: pass `multi_view_thumbnails: true` on image-to-3d / multi-image-to-3d and read `thumbnail_urls` (front/right/back/left, 512×512 PNG) instead of pulling a 50–200 MB GLB just to check the result. ~3s extra latency.
- **Never hardcode `action_id`**: fetch `GET https://api.meshy.ai/web/public/animations/resources` (public, no key, `?category=` to narrow) and match the user's intent against `name` / `category`. IDs are not `1..N` — the catalog includes `-2`, `-1`, `0`.
- **`consumed_credits`**: Every task GET response includes `consumed_credits` — read it to report the real credits spent rather than estimating. A `FAILED` task reports `0` (credits are refunded), so a transient failure can be retried without re-approving the spend.
- **Rigging**: Humanoid bipedal only, polycount ≤ 300,000 (enforced by `check-faces`).
- **Printing formats**: White model → OBJ with `scripts/fix_obj.py`. Multicolor → 3MF from Multi-Color Print API. Always detect slicer first.
- **Download format**: Ask the user which format they need before downloading. GLB (viewing), OBJ (printing), 3MF (multicolor), FBX (games), USDZ (AR). Do NOT download all formats.
- **3MF for multicolor**: Multi-Color Print API outputs 3MF directly — no need to request 3MF from generate/refine. For non-print use cases needing 3MF, pass `"3mf"` in `target_formats`.
- **Timestamps**: All API timestamps are Unix epoch **milliseconds**.
